## Juanita's Pinto Beans


> "The main character of my book, *Dancing on the Edge of the Roof*, Juanita Louis, packs a bag and leaves her Midwestern home for a small town in southwestern Montana. She’s never been anywhere before but Montana is as good a place as any to run away to. Juanita knows her way around a kitchen and the diner she walks into gives her a home base as she recreates herself and prepares for her next adventure . . ." - Shelia Williams


**Ingredients**
- 2 ham hocks (the size of Georgia but purchased in Kentucky, of course)
- 1 bag of pinto beans
- 2 celery stalks
- 3 bay leaves
- chopped white or yellow onion
- a pinch of cumin and cayenne pepper
- salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**
Cover the beans with water, bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, let set for one hour. At the same time, simmer ham hocks in water (to cover). After the hour, drain the beans, add them to the ham hocks and add the spices and other ingredients. Cook on medium to medium low heat until the beans are tender (probably 3 hours or until the ballgame is over). The dish should have a nice broth. Carve up those Georgia-sized ham hocks (throw out the fat and skin) and serve with fresh cooked greens (combination mustard, kale and collard are my favorites) and cornbread (add a pinch of sugar to the batter, that makes it taste better).
