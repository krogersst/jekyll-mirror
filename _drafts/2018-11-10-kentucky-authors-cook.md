  Cook, by Barbara Popyach.

*This blog post was originally published on the [Kenton County Public Library blog](http://kentonlibrary.org) as a part of the Local History and Genealogy Department local cook book series.*

*Kentucky Authors Cook*, by Barbara Popyach, asks Kentucky authors to submit their favorite recipes. While this isn't as historical as the other recipes in this series, it engages with another part of the Local History and Genealogy Department's collection, our local author collection. Each recipe I've chosen is from an author we have in our collection. In fact, the first recipe is one a character cooks up!

## Juanita's Pinto Beans


> "The main character of my book, *Dancing on the Edge of the Roof*, Juanita Louis, packs a bag and leaves her Midwestern home for a small town in southwestern Montana. She’s never been anywhere before but Montana is as good a place as any to run away to. Juanita knows her way around a kitchen and the diner she walks into gives her a home base as she recreates herself and prepares for her next adventure . . ." - Shelia Williams


**Ingredients**
- 2 ham hocks (the size of Georgia but purchased in Kentucky, of course)
- 1 bag of pinto beans
- 2 celery stalks
- 3 bay leaves
- chopped white or yellow onion
- a pinch of cumin and cayenne pepper
- salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions**
Cover the beans with water, bring to a boil. Turn off the heat, let set for one hour. At the same time, simmer ham hocks in water (to cover). After the hour, drain the beans, add them to the ham hocks and add the spices and other ingredients. Cook on medium to medium low heat until the beans are tender (probably 3 hours or until the ballgame is over). The dish should have a nice broth. Carve up those Georgia-sized ham hocks (throw out the fat and skin) and serve with fresh cooked greens (combination mustard, kale and collard are my favorites) and cornbread (add a pinch of sugar to the batter, that makes it taste better).

K WILLI S

Following Shelia's advice, I cook up some greens and find a bread recipe in *Kentucky Authors Cook* to serve with Juanita's Pinto Beans. This recipe for Southern Spoon Bread was submitted by an author who specializes in Appalachian history and culture. I think I might have to cook something from her cookbook, *More than Moonshine* next.

## Southern Spoon Bread

> “It has been said bread is the staff of life. In Appalachia we ate hot bread three times a day - biscuits in the morning, cornbread for dinner in the middle of the day, and a pan of cornbread or a skillet of cornpone for supper.” - Sidney Saylor Farr


**Ingredients**
- 3 cups milk
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 1/4 cup corn meal
- 3 eggs
- 3 tsps baking powder
- 2 tbsp cold water
- 2 tbsp butter

**Instructions**
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.

Mix milk, salt, and sugar in pot, heat to "moderate temperature". Remove from heat and add 1¼ cup corn meal. Stir and return to heat until mush. Meanwhile, beat together eggs, baking powder, cold water and butter. Then beat the egg mixture into the mush and pour into greased casserole or pan. Bake about 25 to 30 minutes.
