    <p>The value “solo artist” is to be used if there is a single artist responsible for the album and does not require a <a href="{{ '/scd/musicartistrole' | relative_url }}">1.6.1.3 musicArtistRole</a> element to refine. See <a href="{{ '/mlis/metadata/schema#appendix-b' | relative_url }}">Appendix B</a> for more information.</p>
