  <td>The role may or might not be listed on the CD packaging. If the specific role isn’t listed in reference to a specific track DO NOT use the artist role(s) listed in <a href="{{ '/scd/musicartistrole' | relative_url }}">1.6.1.3 musicArtistRole</a>. For example, an artist may be listed as an accordion player for the album overall but only specifically listed as a vocalist for the track, thus “accordion” should not be listed as a role under <em>trackArtistRole</em>.</td>
