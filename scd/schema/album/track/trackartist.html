  <td>The specific artists involved in each track might not be listed on the CD, if they are not, do not use <em>1.4.8.1.5 trackArtist</em> and its children. If the album is by a singular artist without any guest or contributing artists listed for particular tracks, do not record <em>trackArtist</em> information. If the tracks are remixes or covers, use <em>trackArtist</em> to record the original artist(s) who created the original song.</td>
