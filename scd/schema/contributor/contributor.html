    <p>DO NO INCLUDE PRODUCER.</p>
    <p>If a contributor is also a music artist, repeat music artistâ€™s information here excluding their music artist roles, only include non-musical contributions. Solo artists who recorded and produced the album themselves do not need to be recorded here. If only a first name is mentioned, do not record the person as a contributor. Music directors and vocal arrangements are classed as music artists whereas recording engineers and project coordinators are contributors. If in doubt, record as contributor.</p>
