<p>Hi all! I’m Kelsey Rogers. I’m originally from the Missouri Ozarks, and went to school in a rural area. My middle school received a grant that gave every student access to a computer and our teachers were trained in how to utilize this new technology, and in turn, we had access to a whole new world. This early experience emphasized the power that digital access to cultural heritage resources can have. Even early 2000s cultural heritage institution's' websites gave us inspiring and engaging access to resources we otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to.</p>

<p>After I graduated with a BA in Anthropology from the University of Missouri, I gained experience at a variety of cultural and natural heritage institutions across Ohio, I'm currently interning with the <a href="http://iwasm.org">International Women's Air & Space Museum</a> where I am assisting in the restructuring and revitalization of their archives. I am in my last semester of my MLIS degree with a focus on digital LAMs (Libraries, Archives, and Museums) at Kent State and will be graduating in Spring 2020. I am currently living in the greater Cleveland area with my girlfriend and our rambunctious rescue kitty Goose.</p>

<p>Today, I would love to give back to my younger self, and create the next generation of websites and projects that provide access to cultural and natural heritage resources in engaging and innovative ways. From <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mlis/spadefoot/home">natural history</a> to <a href="http://visualizingabolition.org">digital humanities</a>, I would love to help you bring your institution's resources to life.</p>
