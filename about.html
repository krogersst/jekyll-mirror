<p>I'm currently a Zoo Interpreter with Columbus Zoo and Aquarium where I get to hold snakes and pet sea stars every day. In between hanging out with kangaroos and manatees, I help others tell their stories. Before living in Ohio I studied anthropology at the University of Missouri where I was the lead designer and programmer for Visualizing Abolition. This fall I will be going back to school to pursue a Masters in Library and Information Science at an as of yet undisclosed location.</p>
