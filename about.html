<p>Hi all! I’m Kelsey Rogers. I'm the curator for Bay Village Historical Society in Northeast Ohio where I get to spend time doing everything from digitization and cataloging to exhibit design and content creation.</p>

<p>Although I've spent the past few years in Ohio, I’m originally from the Missouri Ozarks where my love for digital cultural heritage began. My rural middle school received a grant that gave every student access to a computer, and with it, the internet. We now had access to a whole new world. This early experience emphasized the power that digital access to cultural heritage resources can have. Even museum and library websites in the early 2000's gave us inspiring and engaging access to resources we otherwise wouldn't have been exposed to.</p>

<p>After I graduated with a BA in Anthropology from the University of Missouri, I gained experience at a variety of cultural and natural heritage institutions across Ohio and earned my MLIS degree with a focus on digital LAMs (Libraries, Archives, and Museums) at Kent State. I currently live in the greater Cleveland area with my girlfriend and our rambunctious rescue kitty Goose. I spend my time outside of museums maintaining area free fridges and pantries, exploring the parks and reservations around Cleveland, and obsessively crocheting plarn creations.</p>

<p>Today, I would love to give back to my younger self, and create the next generation of websites and projects that provide access to cultural and natural heritage resources in engaging and innovative ways. From <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mlis/spadefoot/home">natural history</a> to <a href="http://visualizingabolition.org">digital humanities</a>, I would love to help you bring your institution's resources to life.</p>
