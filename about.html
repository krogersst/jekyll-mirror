<p>Hi all! I’m Kelsey Rogers. I’m originally from the Missouri Ozarks, but for the past few years I've made Ohio my home. Right now I'm in Cleveland where I live with my girlfriend and our rambunctious rescue kitty Goose.
</p>
<p>
I graduated from the University of Missouri in 2017 with a B.A. in anthropology. During undergrad, I was lucky enough to be a part of Visualizing Abolition as their lead web designer and programmer. I had to teach myself how to design and code a website as well as create an interactive database including visualizations in under two semesters. The result is visualizingabolition.org and a love for digital humanities.
</p>
<p>
My background gets a little wacky after that with a naturalist internship at Aullwood Audubon Nature Center, a summer as an interpreter at the Columbus Zoo, and most recently a year with the Local History and Genealogy Department at the Kenton County Public Library. Right now I'm starting my second year of my MLIS degree with a focus on digital LAMs (Libraries, Archives, and Museums) with Kent State.
