### My Work

Storytelling runs through every part of our lives, both professional and personal, from books and movies to websites selling car parts. Narratives shape our world. But not every story gets told, not every narrative serves us well. My passion is bringing to light the stories hidden away in archives, in the quiet corners of our lives, the stories that have been passed over and silenced. Powerful storytelling doesn't end with the written word. Thoughtful writing complimented with engaging design creates a cohesive narrative that encourages engagement.
