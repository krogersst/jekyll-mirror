<p><strong>Which objectives were achieved?</strong></p>

<p>I achieved all of the objectives I set out at the beginning of the practicum:</p>

<p><em>1. Increase familiarity with digital LAM platforms such as CONTENTdm</em></p>

<p>I became familiar with three major platforms: CONTENTdm, Omeka, and LibGuides. I created compliant and standardized metadata for over 1,000 photos and newspaper clippings that will be uploaded to Cleveland Memoryâ€™s CONTENTdm database. For Ohio Outdoor Sculpture (OOS), I created sculpture entries from the research stage all the way through to upload, including standardized metadata and photo upload. These entries were directly input into the OOS Omeka database. Further, I went through every sculpture in the database (around 1,400 items) and corrected incorrectly inverted sculptor names. I also created content and updated the departmentâ€™s online local history research guide on the LibGuides platform. This involved transferring valuable content from the old Cleveland Digital Library format to a research guide with high traffic. This enabled me to understand the ins and outs of LibGuides as I worked with previous content and created my own pages.</p>

<p><em>2. Gain hands-on experience with metadata and digital content workflows</em></p>

<p>For the 1,000+ items I indexed for Cleveland Memory, I created descriptive metadata utilizing Library of Congress Authorities and the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus for standardization. I also analyzed the workflow of creating quality metadata through the eyes of a volunteer, creating a Best Practices guide for a crowdsourcing project to enable volunteers to produce high-level metadata submissions to the Cleveland Memory project. I was able to follow and implement every step of the OOS Omeka workflow from the research stage all the way through to upload.</p>

<p><em>3. Contribute content to established digital LAM projects</em></p>

<p>Besides my work contributing to Cleveland Memory, OOS, and CSU Research Guides, I was able to research and write articles for both CSUâ€™s Cleveland Historical digital humanities project and the Encyclopedia of Cleveland History (ECH) of Case Western Reserve University. This enabled me to gain insight into how the same subject can be realized differently according to a projectâ€™s unique requirements. While Cleveland Historical emphasizes engaging, dynamic narratives to be read on a mobile device, ECH focuses on simple, clean entries that provide a useful overview of Clevelandâ€™s History.</p>

<p><strong>Which skill areas need additional development?</strong></p>

<p>My work was mainly done behind the scenes and on digital projects. My experience working with others was limited. Higher level collaboration was limited to a few emails exchanged between a few professionals within CSU and Case Western. But that is the nature of the practicum I chose combined with a pandemic hitting in the last month and a half of the semester. Face-to-face personal collaboration and communication is a skill area that I am always trying to develop further.</p>

<p><strong>What is the overall assessment of the internship experience?</strong></p>

<p>I had a very positive and productive experience. I especially enjoyed being able to write the articles showcasing the research and work of Cleveland Memory. It really connected the more technical, detail-oriented metadata work with the cultural heritage informatics side of librarianship. The wide range of projects I was able to contribute to and the type of projects, really helped me round out my portfolio and implement my coursework in a real hands-on setting.</p>

<p><strong>What connections could you make between the internship experience and coursework experience?</strong></p>

<p>My coursework had many direct connections with my experience. I took the Digital Technologies Series, Introduction to Digital Preservation, Cultural Heritage Informatics, and Metadata Architecture and Implementation during 2019. These courses directly informed my practicum choice. The skills I learned in those course were further developed and built upon during my practicum through all of the metadata creation, hands-on experience of digital project workflows, and cultural heritage projects I contributed to.</p>

<p><strong>What did you learn about yourself in terms of preparing to enter the profession?</strong></p>

<p>This experience further emphasized my love of digital initiatives and the zen-like state I can get into when creating metadata. The varied projects that popped up during the course of the practicum were always fun to turn to, especially the change to expand the work that I put into Cleveland Memory and being able to contribute to other departments and universities. Working on digital initiatives, especially in an academic library setting, provides a great balance of detail work and creativity that I thrive on. I will make sure to look for positions as I start my job search that follow in the same vein as this practicum.</p>

<p><strong>What surprised you about the work you performed and the environment in which you worked?</strong></p>

<p>I was surprised by just how much I needed the ritual of coming into the library to work on metadata creation. The last month working on the Roldo project from home due to COVID-19 has been a struggle. Even though I am able to do metadata creation from my laptop in my apartment just as well as I can at a desk in the library, it takes about ten times as much effort to focus. There is something to be said for getting out of your house, seeing your coworkers, and having that dedicated space to work every day that does wonders even if you can technically work from home.</p>

<p><strong>What would you recommend to other students considering a internship in this setting?</strong></p>

<p>If you want a patron-facing practicum, this might not be the one for you. This setting is first, special collections, and second, digital initiatives. Itâ€™s a lot of computer work in a department that isnâ€™t getting as much foot traffic as the reference desk on the first floor. But if you want to get into the nitty gritty of special collections and digital librarianship, this setting will get you there!</p>
