Throughout the process of building Visualizing Abolition I collected a variety of resources and tutorials that helped me in making a website of this type with all of its associated components, i.e. the plugin that produces the database and visualizations. To make your journey a bit easier, I've put them all in one place. But this doesn't mean you should stop here. The biggest skill I learned during the production of this site was googling my heart out. So explore the almost limitless resources and help people are glad to share with you freely.

#### Programs

* [Atom](https://atom.io) is the love of my life. I cannot recommend it enough.

#### Tutorials

**Writing and Publishing**

* [A Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Sustainable Authorship](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown): An introduction to Pandoc, Markdown, and plain text publication. This provides a more scholarly perspective to work with Markdown.
* [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/): An online markdown editor.

#### Themes

#### Plugins

#### Advanced Stuff

* [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/): a mapping plugin made especially for use with SSGs


##### SSG Resources

* [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/r/knowledgebase/contentful-api-cms-static-site-generators/): a step above SSGs, combines the simplicity and speed of a static site generator with the collaborative dashboard of a CMS based builder like WordPress.
* [Ghost](https://ghost.org/features/) and [Cockpit](https://getcockpit.com/): open source platforms that bridge the gap between CMS and SSGs.
* [Building CMS Free Websites](https://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/07/27/build-cms-free-websites/) and [Using a SSG at Scale](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/using-a-static-site-generator-at-scale-lessons-learned/): great articles on the ins and outs of building CMS free, especially at larger scales.
