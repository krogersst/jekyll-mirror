        <p><strong>Class: </strong>LIS 60637: Metadata Architecture and Implementation (Fall 2019)</p>
        <p>The culminating project for Metadata Architecture and Implementation is the creation of a metadata schema to describe a personal collection. This project applies professional metadata standards, best practices, and guidelines to the creation of an original metadata schema. Using accepted, existing metadata vocabularies as models, I analyzed my collection’s unique aspects in order to create a metadata schema that best describes my resources.</p>
        <p>I chose a collection of amateur and self-published thrifted CDs and created a metadata schema describing the defining features of this unique collection. I created ten XML records using this schema.</p>

        <p><strong>Class: </strong>LIS 60635: Cultural Heritage Informatics (Fall 2019)</p>
        <p>The culminating project for Cultural Heritage Informatics was a website showcasing a cultural heritage object utilizing a variety of visualizations and tools such as a timeline and HistoryPin, as well as demonstrating key skills such as applying Cataloging Cultural Objects standards and using controlled vocabularies. I chose one of my favorite illustrations to explore: a naturalistic study of an eastern spadefoot that was published as a hand-colored lithograph in North American herpetology by John Edwards Holbrook (1836).</p>

        <p><strong>Class: </strong>LIS 60092: Master’s Internship in Library and Information Science (Spring 2020)</p>
        <p>My practicum focused on metadata and digital initiatives within an academic library's special collections. My practicum site was Cleveland State University's Michael Schwartz Library's Special Collections where I worked on a variety of digital initiatives within the library and in partnership with other CSU departments and Cleveland area institutions.</p>
        <p>I completed three learning objectives over the course of 150 hours: 1.) Increased my familiarity with digital LAM platforms such as CONTENTdm; 2.) Gained hands-on experience with metadata and digital content workflows; 3.) Contributed content to established digital LAM projects</p>

        <p>This course project focused on creating a research proposal to investigate a particular user group’s information needs. I synthesized current research on information behaviors and needs of non-specialist users of local history and genealogy resources and created a research proposal and plan to identify patterns of discovery of digital archives.</p>

        <p>This project applies professional metadata and digital preservation standards, best practices, and guidelines to the creation of a metadata dictionary and crosswalk. Drawing on established metadata vocabularies, I created an application profile for my group’s digital preservation project which focused on a collection of Day of the Dead images.</p>

        <p>This course project focused on analysis and assessment of a particular user group. I synthesized current research on information behaviors and needs of museum website users in order to identify actionable recommendations for more effective museum website design. My main takeaway was the importance of providing users with multiple services and modes of interaction with the museum's online collection.</p>

        <p>This culminating project takes an in-depth look into a local museum we hadn’t previously visited. This biography focuses on the museum’s services and internal system to evaluate and assess its effectiveness within the community and its wider environment.</p>
        <p>I chose the Great Lakes Science Center, a nonprofit focused on STEM learning in Cleveland. I analyzed their recent shift towards improving their finances and expanding their programming through reviewing their recent audits, making several tours of the facilities, and an interview with their Communications Director.</p>

        <p><strong>Class: </strong>LIS 60040: Information Institutions and Professions (Spring 2019)</p>
        <p>For this class project, I reviewed current scholarly literature to support a recommendation for effective personnel practices in this fictional memo to the assistant director of a library.</p>
        <p>I identified two goals for the library to strive for in order to prevent staff burnout: Reduce role ambiguity and ensure performance recognition fairness. I further outlined steps to take to achieve these two goals, providing a clear plan for implementing effective personnel practices.</p>
