    <p><em>video transcript</em></p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Kelsey Rogers, I will be graduating this May with my Masters in Library and Information Science.</p>
    <p>Through coursework such as Digital Preservation, Digital Technologies, and Metadata Architecture I have focused my masters on digital libraries, archives and museums. I am particularly interested in creating and supporting digital cultural and natural heritage projects. These online initiatives are essential to providing access to the wonderful resources and collections found all around the world and I would love to create the next generation of engaging and interactive digital library projects.</p>
