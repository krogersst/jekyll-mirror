    <h3>Scaphiopus <em>solitarius</em></h3>
    <p>A hand-colored lithograph of a Scaphiopus <em>solitarius</em> (now Scaphiopus <em>holbrookii</em>) specimen, commonly known as an Eastern Spadefoot toad. The illustration was originally by J. Sera and the lithograph was created and hand-painted by George Lehman of Lehman & Duval Lithographers of Philadelphia. J. Sera prided himself on a distinctive expressiveness in the subjects of his scientific illustrations, usually conveyed through their eyes. The hand-painted colors are likely taken directly from a live Eastern Spadefoot toad. The lithograph was prepared for John Edward Holbrook’s <em>North American herpetology, or A description of the reptiles inhabiting the United States</em> (1836).</p>
