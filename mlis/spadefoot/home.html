    <p>The <strong>eastern spadefoot</strong> (formerly <em>Scaphiopus solitarius</em>) is a toad that lives most of its life underground and only comes out at night. This posed a problem in the early years of North American herpetology (the study of amphibians and reptiles), as specimens would have to be captured and illustrated by hand.</p><p>Additionally, herpetology is one of the less popular branches of zoology. Thus, there are only a few depictions of this elusive animal published before photography was regularly used for natural history publications.</p><p>However, J. Sera, one of the first published illustrators of the eastern spadefoot, was able to portray this elusive toad with a distinctive expressiveness that makes this toad an endearing subject. This illustration was published as a hand-colored lithograph in <a href="{{ '/mlis/spadefoot/thelibrary' | relative_url }}"><em>North American herpetology</em></a> by John Edwards Holbrook (1836).
