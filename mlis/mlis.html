<p>I graduated with a Master's in Library and Information Science from Kent State University in May 2020. My focus was on digital libraries, archives and museums, particularly the development and support of digital initiatives. These include everything from applying user needs analyses to the creation and redesign of institutions' websites to developing and implementing collection metadata.</p>
