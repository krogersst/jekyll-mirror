Throughout the process of building Visualizing Abolition I collected a variety of resources and tutorials that helped me in making a website of this type with all of its associated components, i.e. the plugin that produces the database and visualizations. To make your journey a bit easier, I've put them all in one place. But this doesn't mean you should stop here. The biggest skill I learned during the production of this site was googling my heart out. So explore the almost limitless resources and help people are glad to share with you freely.
